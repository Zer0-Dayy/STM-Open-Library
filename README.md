# STM-Open-Library
A modular collection of open-source STM32 firmware components.
**STM Open Library** is a growing collection of open-source modules for STM32 microcontrollers.  
Each module is written using the official **STM32 HAL** layer and focuses on **clarity, reusability, and educational value**.

The goal is to create a clean, accessible reference for embedded engineers and students who want to learn how to:
- Build modular firmware,
- Integrate hardware peripherals,
- Communicate over UART, SPI, I²C, or Wi-Fi,
- Connect STM32 devices to higher-level systems such as Python servers or databases.
